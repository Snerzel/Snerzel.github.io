I originally started in 2019. I figured the "Problem solving" nature of programing would be a good fit for me. And, being close to silcon valley, I figured it wouldn't be too difficult to get a steady career.

The pandemic kinda tripped me up quite a bit. Combined with the lessons getting reset quite a few times made me frustrated and completely lose steam to keep going. I just got my self-paced course time reset to 15 months. So I'm jumping back into it. Wish me luck!
