     I decided I would build my project around something that I do everyday. I'm in a long distance relationship with a Canadian that I can't see because Canada's closed the borders due to COVID-19. Since I check the cases and vaccinations everyday I made my CLI app do that for me. 

     I found working with GitHub to be quite challenging so I feel my repos may be a little weird. Definitely need to read more about how to use it.
		 
		 I watch a video that used the Learn sandbox to build it so that's where I made mine... Whenever it wasn't crashing. Through many crashes trials and soo many errors I started to get the hang of it. I did hit many dead ends because many site I'd try to scrape weren't actually scrapable. This made my search for scrapable content long and slow. It did however teach me how to spot a scrapable site, through many failed attempts.
		 
		 Scraping the data for Ontario was quite challenging as I could only find one site that I could scrape and it returned a big long string. It took me quite some time but I got it through iterating through it and pushing into an array to then select the parts I needed.

     In the end it was a long process but I learned a lot about how code talks to other parts of code and I'm interested it making gems in my free time as I think of them.
